Game built for Kenney's Jam 2025 using the theme "POWER". 

You are part of a rebel group trying to shutdown operations on a satellite that's being used to spy on earth population.
5 years ago Earth's government flew the satellite as part of a network built to monitorize the citizens of the earth. 
Some of them have been equiped with state of the art scanners and cameras that are able to photograph what happens on the street of the planet. While others contain datacentes that empower Earth's most powerful AI. An agent built to follow all traces of rebellion and able to send special units to end the operation of the rebels. 

You and your team have been working on secret for years to shutdown the network of satellites so that your team on the surface can rise up against the government and end this state of tyrany. 
Today is the day of the coup, and you have been ordered to shutdown satellite A0324, take care that the cameras that watch all rooms in the satellite do not catch you and try to power down the local energy supply for the different rooms to get into the main control room of the satellite to shut it down forever.
